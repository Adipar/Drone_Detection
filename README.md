# Drone_Detection
This model is trained to detect PLUTO-X drones when in the frame of the camera
I've also uploaded the 'Drone.pt' file which you can download first before ru ning the code 

specify the .pt file in the code before running thr code on your respective machine 

if any queries or issues ping me on aadipardeshi@gmail.com

# Drone Detection Using YOLOv5

This project utilizes the YOLOv5 object detection model to identify PLUTO-X drones within video frames. It provides a real-time solution for drone detection using deep learning techniques.

## üß† Overview

The system is designed to detect PLUTO-X drones in real-time from video feeds. It employs a pre-trained YOLOv5 model fine-tuned specifically for PLUTO-X drone detection.
